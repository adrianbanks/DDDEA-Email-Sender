                <p>Hello [NAME],</p>

                <p>The <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#013c01">DDD East Anglia</span> team would like to thank you for submitting a session to this year's event. Unfortunately, your session missed out this time from being in the list of selected sessions on the agenda.</p>

                <p>We hope however that you will still attend the event. Registration opens on <span style="font-weight:bold">Monday 13th August at 10:00</span>. Keep an eye on the site for the link to the registration page.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top:40px">Helpers on the day</h4>

                <p>As with all DDD events, <span style="font-weight:bold;color:#013c01">DDD East Anglia</span> is run entirely by volunteers. We are in need of room monitors to help out on the day. This involves supervising one of the rooms during a few sessions, and prompting the speaker as they approach the end of their alloted time. In return, we offer guaranteed attendance by pre-registering you for the conference before registration opens. If you would be interested in being a helper, please let us know be replying to this email.</p>

                <h4 style="margin-top:40px">Lunchtime &quot;grok&quot; talks</h4>

                <p>A tradition at many DDD events is for attendees to give &quot;grok&quot; talks during the lunch break. These are 5-10 minutes talks, and can be about any subject. If you would like to give a shortened version of your session in the form of a grok talk, or a talk about any other subject, please let us know.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:50px">
